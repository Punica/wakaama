**Overview**
----
  This REST API provides easy to use interface to the LwM2M server and all LwM2M clients (devices) that are connected to it. One of the major issues with LwM2M is that clients may be often be unreachable (e.g. sleepy devices) and it's not possible to perform a direct transaction immediately. For this reason even channel model is used and all REST requests, that result in a (remote) transaction with a LwM2M client, return an asynchronous transaction id. Such calls are marked with **[async]** tag.
  
  Once such transaction is completed (or fails), an asynchronous response message is put into the event channel. The event channel should be regulary polled to retrieve the queued events. If polling is undesired, or better time response is needed, the application can register an event callback address - in such case this REST service will send events immediately and directly to the registered address.
  
  Along with asynchronous responses, other events are also put into the event channel. These include registration, update and deregistration notifications. Event channel structure details can be found below, in the **Poll events** API call description.
  
  The REST API is similar to [MBED Device Connector API documentation](https://cloud.mbed.com/docs/v1.2/legacy-products/api-reference.html) and many functions should be compatible, however some differences are to be expected.

**License**
----
The code in this directory is licensed under the MIT license, however please note that the application uses other libraries (including wakaama) that come under different licenses.

**List connected devices**
----
  Returns a list of devices, that are currently registered to the LwM2M service. Each device entry has a unique identifier (`name`), LwM2M queue mode status (`q`) and, if provided during device registration, a device type. It also has a status field, which must always be `ACTIVE`. If queue mode is enabled (`"q": true`) it means that the device is not accessible immeadiately and asynchronous requests (see below) will take longer to complete.

**Poll events**
----
  Returns all pending events and clears them from the event channel.
  Events are grouped into four types - [re-]registration (`registrations`), update (`reg-updates`), deregistrations (`de-registrations`) and
  asynchronous responses (`async-responses`).
  
  Registration, update and deregistration events contain an id (`name`) of the device which performed the corresponding event.
  Asyncronous response events are created when a response to a previously created asyncronous transaction is received from the device
  or an error happens, e.g. a transaction timeout. Asynchronous responses have an ID (given during async transaction creation),
  status code (`code`) and a base64 encoded payload.
